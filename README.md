# course-repo
This repository contains some codes used by the NXPCup Internship Team.

In the "CLI examples" folder, you will find the solution directory you should obtain if you followed the stepd in the IEA course material under "Week 1/The Ubuntu Operating System".

In the "Example Codes" folder, you will find all PX4 example projects used in week 3.

We highly recommend you try and write your own codes and run your own commands in terminal before cloning this repository. This way you can properly practice the development part of the course. If you face any issues or problems, feel free to reach out to the team!
